DriverPass asked us to create a website to offer driving training options for student drivers.  The website would allow students to create an account, sign up for and take online tests, and make reservations for in-person driving lessons.  I would like to go back and revise the objectives and goals in the business document.  I wrote those early in the process, and they are not clear and concise as I would like them to be. I am most proud of the system I designed to make reservations.  Reservations need four pieces of information to complete: Driver, Car, Timeslot, and Pickup/Drop Off Location.  My system allows the user to select all four pieces concurrently so that they do not have to start over if one item is not to their liking.  I read and re-read the transcript of the initial interview so that I could fully understand and appreciate what the client's needs were.  Once I knew that, I asked myself what would be the best way to accomplish what is being asked.  That way, I could balance what was being asked with practical and financial concerns.  Some practical concerns include time, expertise, setting realistic expectations.  In the future I would want to keep the feedback loop open among the client, the team, and myself to stay on top of concerns and to recognize the team.
